# MIKI HYBL - PORTFOLIO WEBSITE

A friend who is an excellent photographer and focuses on wedding photos needed to create a new website containing a sample of his work.
I designed a simple portfolio website for him using HTML, CSS (SCSS) and JavaScript. FormSubmit (available at https://formsubmit.co/) was used to send emails from the form.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS (SCSS)

## Possible improvements

Creating a better version of the site using some SSR tool (Static Site Generation)
